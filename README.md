# Project-Deploying-a-Scalable-AWS-Architecture-with-Infrastructure-as-Code
Overview

This project demonstrates the design and deployment of a scalable, secure AWS cloud architecture using Terraform, CloudFormation, EC2, RDS, S3, Lambda, CloudWatch, Auto Scaling, and Python Boto3.
It also includes interaction with AWS using the console, AWS CLI, and Python scripts.

This repository contains all required project artifacts, including Terraform scripts, CloudFormation templates, Boto3 automation scripts, architecture diagrams, and deployment instructions.

**Project Objectives**

Design a scalable AWS architecture (VPC, subnets, ALB, EC2, RDS, S3, Lambda).
Deploy the infrastructure using:

1.Terraform for networking

2.CloudFormation for compute + database + serverless

3.Implement an EC2-hosted web application with auto scaling.

4.Create a Lambda function triggered by S3 uploads.

5.Interact with AWS using:
  Console
  AWS CLI
  Python Boto3
